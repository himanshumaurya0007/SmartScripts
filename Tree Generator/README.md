# 🏗️ TreeGenerator - Automated Project Structure Visualizer  

## 📌 Overview  
TreeGenerator is a Python script that automates the visualization of a folder structure. The script prints the directory tree structure to the terminal and also saves it to a `tree_structure.txt` file, making it easier to document and analyze project hierarchies.  

## 📂 Folder Structure Output Example  
When executed, the script generates a structured tree format like this:  
```
Coding\project 
├── a.py  
├── data  
│   ├── dataset.csv  
│   ├── images  
│   │   ├── img1.png  
│   │   ├── img2.png  
│   └── labels.txt  
└── scripts  
    ├── preprocess.py  
    ├── train.py  
    └── utils.py  
```  
This structure is also saved in a file named `tree_structure.txt`.
